About
=====

Finch is a dead-simple OpenAL-based sound player for iPhone.

Goals:

* Play samples without much fuss.
* Do not lag in the `play` method as `AVAudioPlayer` does.

Non-goals:

* Playing background music.

The reasons for coding Finch instead of sticking with `AVAudioPlayer`
are described in my question on [Stack Overflow][so].

Howto
=====

    #import "Finch.h"
    #import "Sound+IO.h"

    // Initializes Audio Session, opens OpenAL device.
    // Do once in the application.
    Finch *soundEngine = [[Finch alloc] init];

    NSString *soundPath = [[[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath]
        stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"SFX/click.wav"];
    Sound *click = [[Sound alloc] initWithFile:path];
    [sample play];

This is alpha code, the interface will almost certainly change.
That said, it should be fairly easy to adapt to changes.

You can do with this code whatever you like.
