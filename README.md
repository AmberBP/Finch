About
=====

Finch is a dead-simple OpenAL-based sound effect player for iPhone. The
reasons for writing Finch instead of sticking with Apple’s `AVAudioPlayer` are
described in my [question on Stack Overflow][so]. The goals are simple: (1)
Play sound effects without much fuss, and (2) do not lag in the `play` method
as `AVAudioPlayer` does. Finch is not meant to play background music. If you
want to play background music, you can go with `AVAudioPlayer`. Finch will play
the sound effects over the background music just fine.

Howto
=====

    #import "Finch.h"
    #import "Sound+IO.h"

    // Initializes Audio Session, opens OpenAL device.
    Finch *soundEngine = [[Finch alloc] init];

    NSString *soundPath = [[[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath]
        stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"SFX/click.wav"];
    Sound *click = [[Sound alloc] initWithFile:path];
    [sample play];

This is alpha code, the interface will almost certainly change. That said, it
should be fairly easy to adapt to changes.

Bugs, gotchas
=============

Many people are having problems with OpenAL sound in the simulator. I have not
found a definitive answer from Apple, but it seems that OpenAL simply does not
work in the simulator. When run on the simulator, Finch will warn you that
OpenAL is probably not going to work.
